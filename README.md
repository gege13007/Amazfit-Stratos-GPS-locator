# Android Wear GPS OpenStreet Maps & GPX reader
Simple &amp; effective GPS locator app for Amazfit Xiaomi android wear
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is the last version of GPS Maps & compass Locator for Wear Android (tested on Xiaomi Amazfit Stratos 2, Stratos 3, PACE, and SUUNTO...). My first idea was to make a simple position reminder with a compass display, or a Golf Gps watch. We have now a Gpx file viewer with Open Street Maps, that's fine.

This app includes 4 main windows :

1/ The Map viewer can display 'Open Street Maps' from zoom level 3 to 16. You can change the zoom level, and center the map on actual position with a simple click on the 3 buttons on the bottom of the screen. A distance scale and the osmap zoom level are displayed on the bottom of the screen. The scale (in km) is equal to the distance represented by the horizontal line. 
The selected GPX points are plotted on the map, with different colors depending on the altitude (blue is deep, and red is hight).
On nav mode, a line is plotted to the destination point.
A blue marker indicates your actual position.
It's possible to move the maps by simply swiping the screen.
A LONG ClICK on the map, let you select your new Destination point (or to save a new waypoint).
A simple click close the map.

Here is an example of 2 levels of zoom from 4 to 15 (maximum details).

2/ The compass is active when you firstly have selected a nav destination (long click on map or compas), or a waypoint in your Gpx file list.
The compass radar will display : the time, distance & altitude to your nav destination.
If you activate the magnetic sensor (with compatible wear) on the config window, the compass will turn to indicate the real direction.
Without magnetic sensor, the north is on the top of screen (at 12 hours).
A Long Click on the compass, let you mark the actual position as new Destination (or to save a new waypoint).
Swipe to close the map.

3/ The Gpx list view, allows you select a destination by simple click on list.
A 'LONG CLICK' remove the point. A 'simple click' select your destination.
You must have a 'gpx' directory on the root of the wear (external storage memory).

4/ The main menu appears even if the position is not ok. So it's possible to change the settings, or to find and select a waypoint to track.
From up left to right : first button start the settings, the second is for select a Gps waypoint from a gpx file.
Third (bottom) is to exit, and the arrow is to start the tracking radar. Storing the current position or not.

5/ The settings view, allows to select a gpx file (it can be an export of your sports activities).
To enable or not, the magnetic sensor and compass mooving (not good for your battery!).
To enable or not the automatic waypoint suggestion.
To sort the waypoints with the distance to actual position (next wpt is the closest), or not (leave in the list order).

Here's the first gps startup screen. This animation just appear for 10 seconds showing the number of satellites in view.
The first gps fixing time depends of your situation, the meteo... From 2 to 30 seconds, it's faster if you don't move...

Where are the MAPS ?
-------------------
You MUST create an 'OSMaps' directory on your wear.
Then in OSMaps, you will have a subdirectory for each zoom level - from '2' (country level) to '16' (to see your home).
In each subdirectory the tiles are stored with their X/Y coordinatess numbers.
Don't worry about that, just download and run 'MOBILE ATLAS CREATOR' ( https://mobac.sourceforge.io/ ).

Click on 'Nouvel Atlas' (OSMdroid ZIP). With the checkboxes on the left you must select the zoom level to include in your atlas.
The level 15 includes small details and is not available for every country or cities. The level 15 represent a 2X size of datas than zoom 14, and 4X than zoom 13. So don't try to select the entire world on zoom level 14 !

Click to valid the checkbox 'Recreer/Ajuster tuiles' !
Click 'Ajouter a la selection', and 'Creer Atlas'.

Unzip the file, and copy all repertories to your wear ("/OSMaps").
You must have something like this.

How this works
--------------
The first activity launches a service who assumes the background task of getting GPS location (with a locationManager and locationListener). This avoid to stop and re-run the gps updates between each activities, and assures that just ONE first fix delay is necessary when you start the app.
The lat & long are broadcasted to the other activities with 'sendBroadcast & broadcastReceiver'.
The first screen uses a 'nmealistener' to get & display a snapshot of the $GPGSV & GPGGA frames.
The location service and its broadcats is only stopped, when the app is destroyed (if not - your battery don't last so long)...
We use the 'magnetic orientation sensor type3' to rotate the compass graduations and map, with a sensorManager.registerListener.

For the Maps, I NEVER get to make it work the OSMdroid library ! NEVER ! So I made my own implementation of the tiles selection formula.
Each OSM tile is a 256x256 png bitmap displayed with usual canvas drawing functions.
Each tile is resized on a 512x512 pixels bitmap, to get more visibility on small screens.

IMPORTANT NOTE !
---------------
Beware of the electric power drawned by the GPS & Magnetic Sensor. There is no problem if you quitt the App by the 'MAIN MENU' - the task & gps will be off. But don't forget to really close the app, if you are in an other view, and quitt the app with a wear button...
